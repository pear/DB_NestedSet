- Added a unified API to access other output drivers- Added a
				output driver for HTML_TreeMenu (Jason Rust)- Added a variable
				&apos;$idfield&apos; to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another
				value than id (Daniel Khan)- Made getChildren() consistent with how
				the other methods work in terms of the secondarySort property (Jason
				Rust)- Added new attribute: secondarySort. Normally it is the order
				field, but can be set to another field in the table such as name so
				that the tree can be displayed alphabetically. (Jason Rust)-
				Improved the error handling so that nasty fatal errors no longer
				occur if invalid ids are specified (Jason Rust)- Now using the
				NESE_MOVE_* constants instead of AF, BE, and SUB (Jason Rust)- Added
				vim folds (Jason Rust)- Several style fixes to be compliant with
				PEAR style (Jason Rust)- Several E_ALL fixes (Jason Rust)- Avoid
				repetitive setting of variables by using sprintf to form the SQL
				queries in many of the _doget* methods (Jason Rust)- db-&gt;quote() is
				now used to quote strings to be compliant with other databases
				(Jason Rust)- Added new property: sequence_table so that it can be
				configurable (Jason Rust)- Added new method: setDbOption in order to
				be able to set database options (Jason Rust)- Added new method to
				NestedSet_Node: getData() to obtain the data from the node in an
				array (Jason Rust)- NestedSet_Node no longer extends PEAR since it
				doesn&apos;t need to (Jason Rust)- Fixed a bug for when moving a node
				within its level (Jason Rust)- Locking does not produce DB &quot;database
				not set&quot; errors any longer since the database destructor calls the
				parent destructor first (Jason Rust)- Fixed a bug in _dogetParents()
				which made it return also return the parent&apos;s sibblings (Daniel
				Khan)

The core package is now stable.You should be able to manipulate a
nested set without problems.The output driver development will
always be in progress and theremay always be drivers in beta
state.This package introduces an output driver for TigraMenu(
        http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/
)and examples on using the output drivers. * Fixed bug in
triggerEvent() which produced an error on node move (Daniel Khan) *
Added isParent() which provides a simple way to query if a given
node is parent of another given node. (Daniel Khan) * Added a
variable to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another
value than id (Daniel Khan) * TreeMenu: Fixed bug where two sub
nodes that both have children were not being processed correctly
(Jason Rust) * TreeMenu: Took off example usage since there is now
an example page in docs/ (Jason Rust) * TigraMenu: Initial import of
TigraMenu output driver

- NEW FEATURESo Now $NeSe-&gt;setAttr() allows a PEAR function
				cache object to be passed using
				$NeSe-&gt;setAttr(array(&apos;cache&apos;=&gt;$cache_object)); if this object is
				set, the class will use it to cache database queries. It will also
				flush this cache if the structure changes.o All tree query methods
				now support an additional array named $addSQL. This can be used to
				pass additional params to a query. Means: You may now use joins to
				other tables.- FIXESo createRightNode() returned the node object
				instead of the new node id, which caused problems whith some
				internal method calls.o TreeMenu and TigraMenu output drivers
				contained a bug which made them not create the whole tree under
				certain circumstances Thanks to Alain Petignat for reporting thiso
				Some minor E_ALL fixes (The package shouldn&apos;t produce
				notices/warnings with E_ALL set)o Added TigraMenu.php to the package
				which was missing in the last release

This release includes many internal changes and some (long
				demanded) feature additions.The API and database structure should be
				fully backward compatible.Please test this release as much as
				possible, so that any remaining issues can beuncovered and resolved
				prior to the final release.o Notes:If you want to use new features
				like preorder sorting you willhave to convert the tree to meet the
				new db model.See docs/migrateDB.txt on how to migrate your existing
				tree.o Fixes:* MDB support is back again.* Fixed a problem with some
				move operations where the moving tree gets changed during the move
				operation.* Many small internal fixes.o New features:* Added a
				method setSortMode($mode) where $mode is NESE_SORT_LEVEL or
				NESE_SORT_PREORDER. This will change the way the query methods
				return the tree. NESE_SORT_LEVEL is the default. NESE_SORT_PREORDER
				returns the tree preorder sorted. This sorting method was often
				demanded as it&apos;s the way one would usually expect the tree to be
				returned. Preorder sorting will also work with the property
				$secondarySort. So it&apos;s possible to get the siblings of one level
				sorted alphabetically by name. Note that you will have to switch
				back to NESE_SORT_LEVEL if you want to display a tree with the
				output drivers.* Added method getParent() to get the immediate
				parent of a node* Added method getSiblings() to get all siblings of
				a node + the node itself* Added method createLeftNode() to create a
				node before a node given by it&apos;s node id.* Added method apiVersion()
				which obviously returns the current API version* Added
				convertTreeModel() to convert a tree into the new tree model* Added
				magic parent db field. If a column with the field mapping &apos;parent&apos;
				is present the parent id of a node is stored inside this column.
				This doesn&apos;t exactly meet the nested sets theory and will only be
				used by some methods like getParent(). It&apos;s recommended to use this
				column for new installations or converted trees.* Now values passed
				to creation methods are verfified so that a script can&apos;t set params
				like the parent id by itself* Added listbox_toHTML() and
				tree_toHTML() methods to the TreeMenu output driver. Thanks to
				Emanuel Zueger for this additions.* Added regression tests for all
				public methods and common options The regression test setup isn&apos;t
				very userfriendly for now. The db schema can be found under docs and
				you will have to customize tests/UnitTest.php to set your database
				connection params.* The main class now uses the array representation
				of the tree for internal operations. This should gain some
				performance.o Notes on next major version (2.0):* The API will
				change.* The class won&apos;t return objects anymore. It will act as if
				$keepAsArray is set to true when calling the query methods. It&apos;s a
				good idea to switch to set this param to be mostly compatible.*
				Callback handlers will be removed - I don&apos;t even know if someone
				uses them. Please mail me at dk@webcluster.at if you really see a
				use. -- To be continued --

- Extended Unit Tests- Added the CoolMenu output driver by
				Andy Crain- Added Andy Crain&apos;s patch which fixes + the can&apos;t move a
				rootnode below another rootnode bug + the &apos;Parent id not updated on
				move&apos; bug + a bug which led to wrong l/r values on tree operations-
				Replaces non ANSI (mysql specific) queries. PLEASE test with other
				RDBMS than mySQL - this should work now* Coding style fixes* Took
				out a few of the abstract methods and _getmicrotime() to try and cut
				down on the size of the class.* Optimized the query for
				createRootNode() slightly* Fixed createRootNode() to work when only
				required parameters are passed, so that now
				$db-&gt;createRootNode($node) will successfully create a root node at
				the end of the tree instead of erroring out.- Fixed [Bug #138]:
				moveTree doesn&apos;t return anything (Thanks to [thomas at bytefreak dot
				de] for the report)- Applied Lukas Smith&apos;s MDB patch - MDB support
				is back again!- Adopted unit tests for MDB- Changed the name of the
				property _flparams back to flparams as some applications may rely on
				this.

This is a quick fix to quoting problems in pgsql.As MDB
				doesn&apos;t support all needed quoting methods for now it&apos;s not possible
				to useany reserved words (key, order, group,...) for column names
				with MDB.As soon as MDB also supports this it should work,Please
				test it as much as possible while I am now finally will finish the
				docs.Please file bugs using the great bug reporting system on
				pear.php.net.If no further bugs are found this branch will be turned
				to stable.- Fixed Bug #1114: bug fix 561 flawed; single-quoting

				test it as much as possible while I am now finally will finish the
				docs.Please file bugs using the great bug reporting system on
				pear.php.net.If no further bugs are found this branch will be turned
				to stable.+ Added PEAR::HTML_Menu output driver This driver is also
				useful if one wants to transform a tree into a nested array. Use
				returnStructure() for this.- Fixed Bug #510: NESE_SORT_PREORDER
				doesn&apos;t work with $aliasFields and $addSQL reported by Beat Kipfer-
				Changed the SQL statement for setting a lock to be ANSI compatible.
				Thank&apos;s to Tobias Marquart- Fixed wrong parameter count in
				getSiblings which caused $addSQL to be ignored. Thank&apos;s to Karsten
				Fernkorn.- Fixed Bug #561: Reserved words are now escpaed using the
				quote() method of the DB layer. Thank&apos;s to c dot weyland at gmx dot
				de.- Fixed Bug #600: Inconsitency in APPEND between methods. Now
				there is a new param for $addSQL called $addSQL[&apos;where&apos;] which takes
				a SQL condition without &apos;AND&apos; or &apos;WHERE&apos; at the beginning. Thank&apos; s
				to Simon Hamilton and Beat Kipfer.- Fixed Bug #808: use of other DB
				as mysql (MSSQL). Thank&apos;s to j dot forstner at a1 dot net.- Fixed
				Bug #1097: getSubBranch does not work with sort_preorder. Thank&apos;s to

ATTENTION: The 1.2 api may not be fully backward compatible to the
current 1.3 api. To avoid surprises when we go stable please make
sure that you test this release candidate with your 1.2 apps. Please
look at http://pear.php.net/package/DB_NestedSet/download/1.3
for informations on the major changes between the 1.2 and the 1.3+
releases. The 1.3.6 release is used in many projects and is
considered to be quite solid. This release fixes some minor bugs.
Finally there is also an end user documentation available! Thanks to
Lukas Linemayr (ll@shopping.at) for writing and maintaining them.
I&apos;d also like to thank tacker (
        http://pear.php.net/user/tacker
) for providing lots of bug reports and patches. If everything goes

This is the final stable version of this package. No bugs occured
during this long time in RC state and it is considered to be quite
solid. We are currently working on DB_NestedSet2 which will provide a
cleaner, pure OOP interface. So watch out for this. Again: ATTENTION:
The 1.2 api may not be fully backward compatible to the current 1.3
api. To avoid surprises when we go stable please make sure that you
test this release candidate with your 1.2 apps. Please look at
http://pear.php.net/package/DB_NestedSet/download/1.3
for information on the major changes between the 1.2 and the 1.3+
releases. Changes in this release: - Changed tests to work with
current versions of PHPUnit.
