      <description>
        DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
        inside a relational database.

        The package provides a way to
        o create/update/delete nodes
        o query nodes, trees and subtrees
        o copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
        o move nodes, trees and subtrees
        o call event handlers on specific events like
          on node deletion
        o output the tree with 
          - PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu
          - TigraMenu (http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
        o It also features caching of SQL queries using PEAR::Cache

        <version>1.2.1</version>
        <date>2003-05-25</date>
        <state>stable</state>
        <notes>
         - NEW FEATURES
         o Now $NeSe->setAttr() allows a PEAR function cache object to be passed using
           $NeSe->setAttr(array('cache'=>$cache_object));
           if this object is set, the class will use it to cache database queries.
           It will also flush this cache if the structure changes.
         o All tree query methods now support an additional array named $addSQL.
           This can be used to pass additional params to a query.
           Means: You may now use joins to other tables.
           
         - FIXES
         o createRightNode() returned the node object instead of the new node id, which
           caused problems whith some internal method calls.
         o TreeMenu and TigraMenu output drivers contained a bug which made them not
           create the whole tree under certain circumstances
           Thanks to Alain Petignat for reporting this
         o Some minor E_ALL fixes (The package shouldn't produce notices/warnings with
           E_ALL set)
         o Added TigraMenu.php to the package which was missing in the last release

        <notes>
         - Fixed a bug which leads to the deletion of a node or subtree if a node
           is moved into _itself_. 
           Thanks to Christian Reininger for catching this!
         - Now a proper PEAR::Error object is returned in case of recursion instead of
           returning false.

        <notes>
         The core package is now stable.
         You should be able to manipulate a nested set without problems.

         The output driver development will always be in progress and there
         may always be drivers in beta state.
         This package introduces an output driver for TigraMenu
         (http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
         and examples on using the output drivers.

          * Fixed bug in triggerEvent() which produced an error on node move (Daniel Khan)
          * Added isParent() which provides a simple way to query if a given node is parent of another given node. (Daniel Khan)
          * Added a variable to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another value than id (Daniel Khan)
          * TreeMenu: Fixed bug where two sub nodes that both have children were not being processed correctly (Jason Rust)
          * TreeMenu: Took off example usage since there is now an example page in docs/ (Jason Rust)
          * TigraMenu: Initial import of TigraMenu output driver

        <notes>
                - Added a unified API to access other output drivers
                - Added a output driver for HTML_TreeMenu (Jason Rust)
                - Added a variable '$idfield' to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another value than id (Daniel Khan)
                - Made getChildren() consistent with how the other methods work in terms of the secondarySort property (Jason Rust)
                - Added new attribute: secondarySort. Normally it is the order field, but can be set to another field
                  in the table such as name so that the tree can be displayed alphabetically. (Jason Rust)
                - Improved the error handling so that nasty fatal errors no longer occur if invalid ids are specified (Jason Rust)
                - Now using the NESE_MOVE_* constants instead of AF, BE, and SUB (Jason Rust)
                - Added vim folds (Jason Rust)
                - Several style fixes to be compliant with PEAR style (Jason Rust)
                - Several E_ALL fixes (Jason Rust)
                - Avoid repetitive setting of variables by using sprintf to form the SQL queries in many of the _doget* methods (Jason Rust)
                - db->quote() is now used to quote strings to be compliant with other databases (Jason Rust)
                - Added new property: sequence_table so that it can be configurable (Jason Rust)
                - Added new method: setDbOption in order to be able to set database options (Jason Rust)
                - Added new method to NestedSet_Node: getData() to obtain the data from the node in an array (Jason Rust)
                - NestedSet_Node no longer extends PEAR since it doesn't need to (Jason Rust)
                - Fixed a bug for when moving a node within its level (Jason Rust)
                - Locking does not produce DB "database not set" errors any longer since the database destructor calls the parent destructor first (Jason Rust)
                - Fixed a bug in _dogetParents() which made it return also return the parent's sibblings (Daniel Khan)
