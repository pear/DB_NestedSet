      <summary>API to build and query nested sets</summary>
      <description>
		DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
		inside a relational database.	
		
		The package provides a way to
		- create/update/delete nodes
		- query nodes, trees and subtrees
		- copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
		- move nodes, trees and subtrees
		- call event handlers on specific events like
		  on node deletion
		- output the tree (at the moment with PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu)
		
		The basic node actions should be pretty stable.
		Event handlers and output API may need some testing.

        <version>1.1-beta</version>
        <date>2003-04-29</date>
        <state>beta</state>
        <notes> 
        	Improved release candidate.
        	Thanks a lot to Jason Rust who joined the development and did very
        	much internal improvements.
        	
        	The package is now very stable.
        	All node operations and queries should work as expected.
        	The event handlers are still beta. I am hoping for comments
        	from users which are using them.
        	
        	The package now includes a output class (beta) which provides an unified
        	API to output a tree.
        	At the moment there is a driver for PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu written by Jason Rust available.

        <notes> 
        	- Added a unified API to access other output drivers
        	- Added a output driver for HTML_TreeMenu (Jason Rust)
        	- Added a variable '$idfield' to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another value than id (Daniel Khan)
        	- Made getChildren() consistent with how the other methods work in terms of the secondarySort property (Jason Rust)
        	- Added new attribute: secondarySort. Normally it is the order field, but can be set to another field 
        	  in the table such as name so that the tree can be displayed alphabetically. (Jason Rust)
        	- Improved the error handling so that nasty fatal errors no longer occur if invalid ids are specified (Jason Rust)
			- Now using the NESE_MOVE_* constants instead of AF, BE, and SUB (Jason Rust)
			- Added vim folds (Jason Rust)
			- Several style fixes to be compliant with PEAR style (Jason Rust)
			- Several E_ALL fixes (Jason Rust)
			- Avoid repetitive setting of variables by using sprintf to form the SQL queries in many of the _doget* methods (Jason Rust)
			- db->quote() is now used to quote strings to be compliant with other databases (Jason Rust)
			- Added new property: sequence_table so that it can be configurable (Jason Rust)
			- Added new method: setDbOption in order to be able to set database options (Jason Rust)
			- Added new method to NestedSet_Node: getData() to obtain the data from the node in an array (Jason Rust)
			- NestedSet_Node no longer extends PEAR since it doesn't need to (Jason Rust)
			- Fixed a bug for when moving a node within its level (Jason Rust)
			- Locking does not produce DB "database not set" errors any longer since the database destructor calls the parent destructor first (Jason Rust)
			- Fixed a bug in _dogetParents() which made it return also return the parent's sibblings (Daniel Khan)
